Authorization Request
To request authorization, the client (website) must redirect the user-agent (browser) to make a secure HTTP call to https://www.amazon.com/ap/oa with the following parameters. If you are using the Authorization header to request access tokens, note that it should be a base-64 encoding of client_id:client:secret.

Access Token Request
After the client (website) receives an Authorization Response with a valid authorization code, it can use that code to obtain an access token. With an access token, the client can read a customer profile. To request an access token, the client makes a secure HTTP POST to https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token with the following parameters:


amazon.go package

var Endpoint = oauth2.Endpoint{
	AuthURL:  "https://www.amazon.com/ap/oa",
	TokenURL: "https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token",
}

Call the profile Endpoint Server-side see://///  https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/obtain-customer-profile.html
If you are calling the profile endpoint directly, you can specify the access token in one of three ways: as a query parameter, as a bearer token, or using x-amz-access-token in the HTTP header. For example:

https://api.amazon.com/user/profile?access_token=AtzaIIQEBLjAsAhRmHjNgHpi0UDme37rR6CuUpSR...
GET /user/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: api.amazon.com
Date: Wed, 0l Jun 20ll l2:00:00 GMT
Authorization: Bearer Atza|IQEBLjAsAhRmHjNgHpi0U-Dme37rR6CuUpSR...
GET /user/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: api.amazon.com
Date: Wed, 0l Jun 20ll l2:00:00 GMT
x-amz-access-token: Atza|IQEBLjAsAhRmHjNgHpi0U-Dme37rR6CuUpSR...
 Tip: Access tokens contain characters that are outside the allowed range for URLs. Therefore, you should URL encode access tokens to prevent errors. For more information, see Section 2.1 of RFC3986.
